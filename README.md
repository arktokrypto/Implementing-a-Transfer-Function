# Implementing-a-Transfer-Function
The continuous time transfer functions, whether it be a controller, filter, or a compensator, has to be converted to an implementable form to use in a microcontroller. This matlab code helps to convert the second order transfer function to discrete transfer function(z-domain) and then to a difference equation form.
